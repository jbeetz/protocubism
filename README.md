## protocubism
Is a period in art history just before the arrival of Cubsim. It is defined as an experimental and exploratory phase of development that resulted in the foundation of the artistic movement: Cubsim.

This project is an incubator for such experiments and explorations. Instead of two-dimensional abstraction, this space will tend to focus on the virtual abstraction of human interaction with computer based systems.

Each project in this portfolio will focus on a seperate aspect (sometimes related) of human interaction with computer systems.
