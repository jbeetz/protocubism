## Welcome to the Blink Prototype App

This is a simple guide to help you understand what the app is doing while you're using it.

We you first visit https://www.mshrwb.com you're presented with an option to participate in the development of this algorithm. By clicking yes, a cookie is set in your browser to remember your choice. After you've submitted a query to the algorithm and image results have been displayed, based on your preferences set in the cookie you either have an option to decide if an image is relevant or not relevent. Cookies set to No do not see this option. 

## What happens when you select an image relevant or not relevant?
Relevant and Not Relevant images get stored in a database along with the search term, and additional data for later study. 

## Your Privacy
This prototype does not collect any personal data from the user, except where that user has indicated that they would like to contribute and has selected an image as Relevant or Not Relevant. The personal data collected is only the image, search term and time of day. All data is anonymous. 

You're contribution to the development of the alogrithm behind the app is tremendously appreciated.

We're currently accepting any offer to help with this project.
