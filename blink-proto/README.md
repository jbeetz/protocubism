#Blink protoype

This project is an attempt to provide a means of interaction between Blink 2019 Festival Attendees and a display.

Our working example is currently here:
https://mshrwb.com/

This repo is not the code repository, rather a documentation repository. The source code for this project will eventually be made public under an OS license (yet to be determined).
